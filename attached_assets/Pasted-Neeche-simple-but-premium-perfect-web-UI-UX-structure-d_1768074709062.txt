Neeche simple but “premium + perfect” web UI/UX structure de raha hoon — jisme sirf 1 page MVP hoga, par feel “complete product” jaisa aayega. (Backend baad me.)

1) One-page Layout (Above the fold)
A) Top Bar (Sticky)

Left: Logo + Product name
Center (optional): “Ask anything. Get verified answers.”
Right:

“Examples” (dropdown)

“How it works” (modal)

Theme toggle (Light/Dark)

Top bar clean rakho. No clutter.

2) Main Hero Section (Center focus)
A) Headline

Big: “Ask. Submit. Get the best answer.”
Small subline: “Uses multiple models + web sources when needed.”

B) Input Area (Main component)

A large rounded input box (textarea, 3–6 lines) with:

Placeholder: “Type any question… (news, coding, business, life, anything)”

Character counter (optional, small)

Attachment icons disabled for v1 (keep minimal)

C) Primary CTA Button

Right bottom of input or below:

Button text: “Generate Answer”

Secondary small text: “Enter ↵ to send”

D) Quick Options Row (tiny toggles)

Under input, 3 compact chips:

Web Sources: Auto / Off

Answer Style: Short / Detailed (default Short)

Output: Plain / With Sources (default With Sources ON when web used)

Ye chips user ko control feel dete hain without complexity.

3) Result Section (Appears after submit)
A) Result Card (Main)

A big card with:

Answer title: “Answer”

Answer text (readable line height)

B) Action Buttons (Top-right of answer card)

Copy

Regenerate

Share link (optional v1)

Download (PDF) (optional v1, can keep off)

C) “Confidence + Method” strip (small)

A subtle row under the answer:

Confidence: High / Medium / Low

Method: “Model-only” OR “Web + Sources”

Ye trust banata hai.

4) Sources Section (Only if web used)

A separate card: “Sources”
Each source as a compact item:

Site favicon + title

1–2 line snippet

Time/Date if available

Clickable link

Also add:

“Show more sources” expand/collapse

“Open all in new tabs” (optional)

5) “Reasoning / Steps” (Keep private, but show user-friendly)

Instead of showing chain-of-thought, show:

“How it got this”

3–5 bullet steps like:

Identified what you’re asking

Pulled sources (if needed)

Compared information

Generated final answer

This looks premium + transparent, without exposing internals.

6) Empty State (When user hasn’t asked yet)

Show 6 clickable example cards (chips):

“Summarize this topic…”

“Compare X vs Y…”

“Write a professional email…”

“Explain this like I’m 12…”

“Give me steps to…”

“Latest news about …” (this triggers web)

7) Loading State (Very important UX)

When user clicks Generate:

Show animated skeleton in answer card

Show live status line:

“Understanding question…”

“Searching sources…” (if on)

“Writing answer…”

And a cancel button:

“Stop”

8) Error States (No mistakes)

No internet / search fail:
“Couldn’t fetch sources. Showing best model-only answer.”

Model error:
“Something went wrong. Try regenerate.”

Unsafe request (if any):
Show polite refusal card.

Color System (Simple, premium, universal)

Pick a neutral + tech theme (works globally):

Light Mode

Background: #0B0F17 (actually this is dark; so use below)
Let’s define properly:

Light

Background: #F7F8FB

Surface cards: #FFFFFF

Primary (CTA): #2563EB (blue)

Text: #0F172A

Muted text: #64748B

Borders: #E2E8F0

Success: #16A34A

Warning: #F59E0B

Error: #EF4444

Dark Mode

Background: #0B1220

Surface cards: #111B2E

Primary (CTA): #3B82F6

Text: #E5E7EB

Muted: #94A3B8

Borders: #22304A

Blue primary safe hai, “trust” feel deta hai. Global.

Font: Inter / system UI

Headline: 44–56px

Body: 16–18px

Line height: 1.6

Border radius: 16–20px

Max width: 920px center
